# Retail Food Waste & Demand Analytics System

A multi-restaurant analytics and decision-support dashboard designed to identify production-demand mismatch, reduce food waste, and improve profitability in retail food businesses.

## Project Overview

Retail food businesses often face overproduction, leading to food wastage and revenue loss.  
This system analyzes historical production and sales data to:

- Detect high-waste items
- Quantify financial impact
- Suggest optimized production levels
- Monitor expiry-related risks
- Simulate potential savings from waste reduction

The dashboard provides both operational monitoring and strategic insights.
